# Arrangings things

Code for [my article](https://alvin.codes/writing/arranging-2d-3d)

All of the action happens in `sketch.js`.

I've used the [Live Server Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=negokaz.live-server-preview) extension for VSCode to live-reload the changes to the p5.js sketch.

`Ctrl + Shift + P` -> Show live preview

> [!NOTE]
The p5.svg plugin used here is unmaintained, let's not try to upgrade it
